## A Shameless ripoff of [Pomotroid](https://github.com/Splode/pomotroid). That I am creating to practice my Rust skills and to try and learn [Slint](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint)

### Reasons I started this project
- Wanted to practice rust
- Wanted to try a GUI and picked Slint
- There are a handful of things I haven't tried doing before
    - Tray Icon
    - Cross platform conditional logic (such as handling the tray icons on Windows and Linux)
    - Doing some unusual stuff with Slint, like manually re-creating the window frame
- But has a limited enough feature set that I might actually complete the project some day.

### Why Mimic Pomotroid?
It seemed like a relativly nice clean design, and I don't claim to be the best UI / UX Designer in the world. Copying someone elses design allows me to focus on learning Slint and practicing Rust instead of struggling to come up with a good design. It also gives me a target to aim for, for example trying to figure out how to animate a [path in slint](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/discussions/2722) instead of giving up quickly and modifying the design to suite what is easy.
